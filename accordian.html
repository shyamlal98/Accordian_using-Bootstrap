                Mysore (or Mysuru), a city in India's southwestern Karnataka state, was the capital of the Kingdom of Mysore from 1399 to 1947. In its center is opulent Mysore Palace, seat of the former ruling Wodeyar dynasty. The palace blends Hindu, Islamic, Gothic and Rajput styles. Mysore is also home to the centuries-old Devaraja Market, filled with spices, silk and sandalwood.
                Referred to as the cultural capital of Karnataka, Mysore is well known for the festivities that take place during the period of Dasara; the state festival of Karnataka. The Dasara festivities, which are celebrated over a ten-day period, were first introduced by King Raja Wodeyar I in 1610.[80] On the ninth day of Dasara, called Mahanavami, the royal sword is worshipped and is taken on a procession of decorated elephants, camels and horses.[80] On the tenth day, called Vijayadashami, the traditional Dasara procession (locally known as Jumboo Savari) is held on the streets of Mysore which usually falls in the month of September or October. The idol of the Goddess Chamundeshwari is placed on a golden mantapa on the back of a decorated elephant and taken on a procession, accompanied by tabla, dance groups, music bands, decorated elephants, horses and camels.[80] The procession starts from the Mysore Palace and culminates at a place called Bannimantapa, where the banni tree (Prosopis spicigera) is worshipped.[80] The Dasara festivities culminate on the night of Vijayadashami with a torchlight parade, known locally as Panjina Kavayatthu.[80]

Mysore is called the City of Palaces because of several ornate examples in the city. Among the most notable are Amba Vilas, popularly known as Mysore Palace; Jaganmohana Palace, which also serves as an art gallery; Rajendra Vilas, also known as the summer palace; Lalitha Mahal, which has been converted into a hotel; and Jayalakshmi Vilas.[81]:87–88 The main palace of Mysore was burned down in 1897, and the present-day structure was built on the same site. Amba Vilas palace exhibits an Indo-Saracenic style of architecture on the outside, but a distinctly Hoysala style in the interior.[81]:82 Even though the Government of Karnataka maintains the Mysore palace, a small portion has been allocated for the erstwhile Royal family to live in. The Jayalakshmi Vilas Mansion was constructed by Sri Chamaraja Wodeyar for his daughter Jayalakshammanni. It is now a museum dedicated to folk culture and artifacts of the royal family

One can go on praising the Taj Mahal, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, with an uninterrupted flow of adjectives – magnificent, outstanding, amazing and incredible. However, none of those can accurately do justice to its beauty. The only way to do that is to visit this incredible structure made of pure white marble. Everything about it reflects grandeur, from its minarets to its dome.

Shah Jahan had this monument built for his wife Mumtaz to express his undying love for her, and today, lovers cite this as an example when expressing their love to each other. The construction of the Taj Mahal, which is also one of the must visit UNESCO World Heritage Sites In India, took around 22 years to complete, and no wonder, the effort of every year is reflected in its construction.

<b>Do you know?</b> Inspired by the Taj Mahal, Dubai is planning to build a hotel and shopping complex which is estimated to be four times larger than the original structure.

                Red Fort, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a symbol of the Mughal Empire at its peak. The enormous size, aesthetic proportions and style, all represent an age of unrestrained opulence. Amidst the unceasing bustle of Old Delhi, stands this colossal monument, evoking nothing but admiration from the onlookers.

Red Fort, which is one of the popular forts and palaces in India, was also built by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan. It took over 10 years to complete, and was constructed when the emperor decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Back then, the fort was known as Qila-e-Mubarak. It is from the ramparts of Red Fort that the Prime Minister delivers his speech on Independence Day.

<b>Do you know?</b> The Red Fort, as you know it, wasn’t always red. In fact, it was white as it was made of limestone. It was the British who painted it red when the limestone began peeling off.

The Qutub Minar, another UNESCO World Heritage Site, is an incredible example of Indo-Muslim architecture that touches the skies at an incredible height of 240ft. It is named after Qutub-ud-din Aibak, the first Muslim ruler of North India. The place where Qutub Minar stands is usually regarded as the site of the first Muslim kingdom in northern India.

Verses from the Quran are finely carved onto its red sandstone stories, with most of them being mostly in Arabic. Another interesting fact is that the first mosque in India, Quwwat-ul-Islam Masjid, is located at the foot of the Qutub Minar.

<b>Do you know?</b>The Qutub Minar Complex also consists of an iron pillar which has not rusted even after a period of 2,000 years.

<b>Don’t miss:</b> You should absolutely attend the decorative light show every evening from 6:30pm to 8:00pm. The Qutub Minar Festival which is held in October / November should also not be missed.
